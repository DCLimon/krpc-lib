Reference Frames
================

vessel.reference_frame
----------------------
Frame rotates with vessel's attitude changes

- x term points from CoG directly over the R wing
- y term points from CoG, thru the nose, to the Whiskey vector
- z term points from CoG out the bottom of the vessel

vessel.orbital_reference_plane
-------------------------------
May change as vessel moves around its orbit, but does not rotate with
attitude changes.

- x term points from CoG toward center of body being orbited (radial(-))
- y term points from CoG in orbital prograde direction, tangent to orbit at vessel's current position
- z term points from CoG in orbital normal(+) (toward the vessel's "North Pole")

vessel.surface_reference_frame
-------------------------------
Frame does not rotate with changes in vessel attitude

- x term is an extension of a line from the center of the orbited body, through vessel's CoG, away from the body (radial(+))
    - basically point upward & is directly perpendicular to plane of ground below
- y term points to the Northern horizon
    - points where a compass kept flat relative to ground below would indicate North
- z term points to the Eastern horizon
    - points where that same compass would indicate East

vessel.surface_velocity_reference_frame
----------------------------------------
Frame rotates as vessel velocity vector rotates

still standard (x,y,z) format, but described out-of-order to make more sense

- y term points from CoG toward vessel surface velocity vector (regardless of nose position/slip angle/AoA)
- z term points from CoG to the horizon at R-ang to y
- x term point from CoG in whatever direction is orthogonal to y & z, acting as thumb in R-hand rule

these vector components obey R-hand rule

- start with index & middle
    - orient middle toward velocity vector to create y while keeping index parallel to floor to define z
- extend thumb to show direction of x
